Learn more about the importance of offline-first with Jake Archibald.
**To do**: have a service worker generator able to handle as many as useful caching strategies possible, as gulp options, while DRY and KISS. 


#### Firebase

####Lock.js
for auth0 capabilities

 - Reveal.js, for its speed, its shell layout and its simple router
